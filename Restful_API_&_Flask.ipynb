        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "->Sure! A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Think of it as a standardized way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet.\n",

        "2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "->An API specification is a detailed document that explains how to use an API, outlining its endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses. It's like a user manual for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "->Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It's popular for building APIs because it's simple, easy to learn, and provides just the essential tools you need without being overly complex, allowing for rapid development.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "->In Flask, routing is the process of mapping URLs to specific Python functions. When a user accesses a particular URL in your Flask application, routing determines which function should be executed to handle that request and generate a response. It's like defining the paths and actions for your API endpoints.\n",

        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "->In Flask, the @app.route() decorator is used to associate a URL path with a specific function. When a user visits that URL, the decorated function is executed to handle the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "->GET requests are used to retrieve data and send parameters in the URL, while POST requests are used to send data to the server, typically in the request body, for creating or updating resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "->In Flask APIs, you can handle errors by using error handlers. These are functions decorated with @app.errorhandler() that are triggered when a specific HTTP error code occurs. You can define custom error pages or return JSON responses with error details.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "->To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy or a database connector library specific to your database (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, mysql.connector for MySQL). You configure the database connection details in your Flask application and use the ORM or library to interact with the database within your application routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "->Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that simplifies the use of SQLAlchemy within Flask applications. It provides helpful defaults and integrates SQLAlchemy with your Flask application's configuration and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "->Flask blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into smaller, reusable components. They are useful for structuring larger applications, breaking down complex logic into manageable parts, and promoting code reusability across different parts of your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "->In Flask, the request object holds all the incoming request data, such as form data, query parameters, files, and headers. It allows you to access and process the information sent by the client to your API.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "->You create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask by using the @app.route() decorator on a Python function. This decorator maps a specific URL path to the function, which will handle requests to that endpoint. You can then use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) within that function to interact with resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "->The purpose of Flask's jsonify() function is to serialize Python dictionaries or other data structures into JSON format and return them as a JSON response with the appropriate content type header. This is commonly used when building RESTful APIs to send structured data back to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
        "->Flask's url_for() function is used for URL building. It takes the name of a function (usually a view function) as its first argument and any variable parts of the URL rule as keyword arguments. It then returns the URL for that function, making your application more flexible and resistant to URL changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "->Flask handles static files like CSS and JavaScript by serving them from a designated folder (by default, named static) within your application directory. You can reference these files in your templates using the url_for() function with the endpoint name 'static'.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "->An API specification is a detailed document that explains how to use an API, outlining its endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses. It helps in building a Flask API by providing a clear blueprint for development, ensuring consistency, and making it easier for other developers to understand and use your API.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "->HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error). They are important in a Flask API because they provide clients with standardized feedback on whether their requests were successful and, if not, what went wrong, aiding in error handling and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "->To handle POST requests in Flask, you can specify the methods argument in the @app.route() decorator to include 'POST'. Inside the decorated function, you can access the data sent in the POST request using Flask's request object, specifically request.form for form data or request.get_json() for JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "->To secure a Flask API, you can implement measures like using HTTPS, authenticating users with methods like token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), authorizing access to resources based on user roles, validating and sanitizing input data to prevent injection attacks, and rate limiting requests to protect against denial-of-service attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "->Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies building REST APIs with Flask by providing abstractions and conventions for common tasks like resource routing, request parsing, and response formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "->In Flask, the session object is used to store data specific to a user's session across multiple requests. This allows you to maintain state and remember information about a user as they interact with your application."
